* Sub domain = That's where you start your application.

Note how we use the terms "organization", "user" and "account":

* A user is one person (e.g. you) who's using our app.
* In most cases our customer will be a company, we call them "organization" in our management app. Each organization can have multiple users and multiple accounts.
* An account is a separate instance of our app. Every account has its own database and its own domain name. Most of the time, an organization has only one account but you may add more e.g. for testing or for separate departments

## Decide What Setup-Type to Use

You'll get always the same app (and the same pricing), but there are two typical szenarios, so we've splitted our guide.

### Feed Engine

This feed engine quick start guide assumes you edit your product data elswhere and just want to distribute them e.g. to marketplaces. In this case you often don't need all product facets
like weight or customs tariff numbers. We just need a name, description, price and some other basic infos. Here we describe how to automatically import your products, validate them and create an example feed.

### Real PIM

Choose this guide, if you plan to manage products of different types with all their details in our app. Typically that means we'll import only single attributes from other system (e.g. stock).
