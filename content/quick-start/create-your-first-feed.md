A place where you want to use your product data is called a "channel" in our solution. That means, we want to create a new channel.

1. Go to "channels"
2. Click "add"
3. Give it a meaningfull name
4. Go to tab "data sets" and add a new one with source "products".
5. Add the fields you want to see in your feed
6. Go to tab "output" and define how others can access your feed. The most common setting is "http pull" (that means, you'll get an url and others can retrieve your feed from there).
